# About Me
My name is Samuel, and I'm from Brazil. I was born on February 26, 2001. I hold a technical degree in Electrical Engineering from Senai, where I developed a strong foundation in electrical systems, circuit design, and automation. <br>

My passion for technology drives me to continuously learn and explore new advancements in the field. I'm particularly interested in how emerging technologies can be integrated into everyday life to improve efficiency and innovation. <br>

In addition to my professional interests, I have a deep love for science. I enjoy understanding how things work, whether it's through reading, experiments, or discussions. This curiosity extends to various branches of science, from physics to biology.<br>

Outside of academics and work, I find great joy in playing basketball. It's not just a sport for me but also a way to stay active, relieve stress, and connect with others. Whether it's shooting hoops with friends or watching professional games, basketball is a significant part of my life.<br>

I'm always eager to take on new challenges and expand my horizons, both professionally and personally. Whether it's diving into a complex project, experimenting with new technology, or simply enjoying a good game of basketball, I approach everything with enthusiasm and a positive attitude.
